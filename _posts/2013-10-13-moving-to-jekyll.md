title: "Moving to Jekyll"
---

Not so while ago I've decided to move to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform.
It's really lightweight and flexible. May be, too much flexible.

But it happens that I am already missing those things in my blog.

By the way I started to write my posts in english (I'm native russian speaker), so feel free to point out my errors.
It's hard to memorize typing "i" in capital case.
