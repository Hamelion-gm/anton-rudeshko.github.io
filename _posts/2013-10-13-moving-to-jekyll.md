title: "Moving to Jekyll"
category: life

Not so while ago I've decided to move my blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static sites platform.
[Google's Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) is great and I continue strongly recommending it
but later I've noticed that it is quite slow, bloated with stuff that I don't need and there is no way to deliver
beautiful and neat code snippets.

Jekyll gives me opportunity to make my blog lightweight, flexible and pleasurable to read so I'll try to do my best.
For now I've spent a lot of time to develop base structure and style and sometimes it feels like reinventing the wheel.

Also I started to write my posts in English (I'm native Russian speaker) to reach a larger audience,
so feel free to point out my mistakes.
This blog is powered by [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) and there is
[a git repo](https://github.com/anton-rudeshko/anton-rudeshko.github.io) behind the scenes
so you can even fix something for me or file an issue.

Subscribe and have a nice day!
